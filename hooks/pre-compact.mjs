// projectstore — PreCompact hook.
//
// Fires before context compaction (both manual /compact and automatic).
//
// ONE channel: `systemMessage`, the line the user sees in their /compact
// output. PreCompact has no `additionalContext` — the runtime rejects the whole
// object when one is present, taking `systemMessage` down with it, so for its
// entire history this hook assembled a packet, printed a red validation error,
// and reached nobody. Agent-facing continuity after a compaction is
// SessionStart's job, on `source: "compact"` (spec contract 19).
//
// What this hook may CLAIM is narrower than what it knows, and deliberately so:
//   - naming the in-flight artifact is always safe — it is a fact about the log
//     it just read, not a promise about the future;
//   - promising that context comes back requires `trigger === "manual"` AND
//     `auto_inject !== false`, the two falsifiers knowable at claim time;
//   - promising that RECENT FILES come back additionally requires the log to
//     have resolved nonempty, because an empty log renders nothing there.
//
// Session identity comes from Claude's own session_id in stdin input (so two
// Claude instances on the same project don't share activity).
// Silent no-op when no projectstore config is present.
