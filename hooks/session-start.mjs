// projectstore — SessionStart hook.
// 1. Reads .claude/projectstore.json from the project root. If absent or
//    auto_inject=false, silently no-ops.
// 2. Registers this session in <vault>/.projectstore/sessions/<id>.json,
//    keyed by Claude's own session_id from hook stdin. Cleans stale
//    entries (>24h). Detects other active sessions (mtime < 30min) and
//    appends a warning so the agent knows it is not alone on this vault.
// 3. Injects a NAVIGATION SKELETON — the layout's folders, what each is for,
//    what is in flight, and the order to descend in. Not a copy of the vault:
//    it used to inject every folder README, which on a real vault exceeded the
//    10,000-character hook cap and was written to a file the agent then had to
//    open. Bounded and O(1) in vault size by construction.
