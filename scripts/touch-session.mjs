// projectstore — touch-session.mjs
//
// Called by BOTH the PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks, and gated on which:
// a write inside the vault fires both events, so without the gate the pointer
// patch below would run twice per call — and that patch is the unguarded
// read-modify-write the entry-rule state deliberately avoids.
//
// Responsibilities:
// 1. Liveness — touches this session's registration file (mtime) so other
//    sessions can see we are active. Bootstraps the record on first call
//    when SessionStart did not run (plugin installed mid-session via
//    /reload-plugins, or rare path where SessionStart was skipped).
// 2. Activity log — extracts the target file path from the tool input
//    and, if it lives inside the vault, appends an entry to
//    `recent_activity` in the session file (capped at 50, deduped).
//    The PreCompact hook reads this list to build a survival packet.
// 3. Entry-rule detection (PostToolUse only) — counts distinct SOURCE paths
//    written this session and, once the threshold is reached with no story
//    open, emits the one advisory reminder. PostToolUse rather than
//    PreToolUse because it fires only after a call succeeds, so declined
//    edits are not counted as work that happened. Spec: "Entry-rule
//    detection: the score, the open-story predicate, and the delivery seams".
//
// Session identity comes from Claude's own `session_id` field in the
// hook input JSON (stdin), so two Claude Code instances open on the
// same project get distinct session files.
//
// Silent no-op when there is no projectstore config, when stdin lacks
// session_id, or on any error — a PreToolUse hook must never crash the
// user's tool call.
