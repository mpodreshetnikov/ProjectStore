# Harnesses — one source, every agent CLI

projectstore runs on more than one agentic harness. Claude Code and Codex are
bundled; a third is a JSON file away.

This page is the contract for anyone adding a feature or a harness. The short
version: **you write a feature once, in Claude Code's shapes, and the repository
makes sure it reaches everywhere else.** That is enforced by tests, not by
remembering.

## The layers

```
commands/  agents/  skills/  hooks/hooks.json     ← SOURCE. Hand-written.
scaffold/  templates/  scripts/*.mjs             ← CORE. Harness-neutral compute.
harnesses/<id>.json                              ← One capability manifest per harness.
        │
        │  node scripts/build-adapters.mjs
        ▼
adapters/<id>/**                                 ← GENERATED. Never hand-edited.
        │
        │  node scripts/install-<id>.mjs
        ▼
~/.<id>/  (or <project>/.<id>/)                  ← What the harness actually reads.
```

`scripts/harness.mjs` is the only module allowed to read a harness-branded
environment variable. Everything else asks it for a path, a tool name or a
command spelling, and gets the active harness's answer.

## What each harness gets

| Surface | Claude Code | Codex |
|---|---|---|
| Project instructions | `CLAUDE.md` → `@AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md`, read natively |
| Hooks | `hooks/hooks.json` | `~/.codex/hooks.json` (identical JSON contract) |
| Slash commands | `commands/*.md` → `/projectstore:adr` | `prompts/*.md` → `/projectstore-adr` |
| Subagents | `agents/*.md` (YAML + markdown) | `agents/*.toml` (`developer_instructions`) |
| Skills | `skills/<n>/SKILL.md` | same, plus a required `name:` key |
| Approval gate | `AskUserQuestion` | a plain-text numbered prompt (model-honoured — see below) |
| Status line | `statusLine` slot | — no equivalent; not ported |

The hook event names and the stdin/stdout JSON are the same on both, which is
why the core hooks are shared verbatim rather than reimplemented.

## The three invariants

`tests/portability.test.mjs` is the whole mechanism. Each invariant closes a
different way for a feature to end up on one harness only.

**1 — Staleness.** The committed `adapters/` trees must be byte-identical to
what the generator produces right now. Add a command and forget to regenerate,
and the suite fails naming the file you did not produce.

```
✖ INVARIANT 1: committed adapter trees match what the generator produces
    never generated: adapters/codex/prompts/projectstore-zztest.md
    Run: node scripts/build-adapters.mjs
```

**2 — Lint.** No harness-branded fragment may survive into a generated file. It
checks the *output*, not the source, so a token with a rewrite rule passes and
an unmapped one fails:

```
✖ INVARIANT 2: no harness-branded fragment survives into a generated file
    adapters/codex/prompts/projectstore-status.md
      leaked: "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"  (pattern /\$\{?CLAUDE_[A-Z_]+\}?/)
```

**3 — Coverage.** Every surface must reach every registered harness, or say in
its own frontmatter why it does not. This is the direction that matters when a
harness is *added*: the new one cannot quietly receive a subset.

## Adding a feature

Write it in `commands/`, `agents/` or `skills/` exactly as you would have
before, then:

```bash
node scripts/build-adapters.mjs
node --test tests/portability.test.mjs
```

Commit the source and the regenerated tree together. If the lint objects, you
have three options and should pick honestly:

* **The token has an equivalent** → add a rewrite rule to `harnesses/<id>.json`.
  Rules apply in declared order by plain substring replacement, so a specific
  rule must precede its catch-all. A test enforces that ordering.
* **The concept does not exist elsewhere** → gate the passage:

  ```markdown
  <!-- projectstore:harness only=claude-code -->
  Open `/plugin` → Marketplaces and toggle auto-update.
  <!-- /projectstore:harness -->
  <!-- projectstore:harness except=claude-code -->
  Pull the checkout and re-run `node scripts/install-harness.mjs`.
  <!-- /projectstore:harness -->
  ```

  **Which side of the comment the body goes on matters.** Claude Code reads
  `commands/`, `agents/` and `skills/` directly, markers and all — so a visible
  block that *excludes* it still delivers its body as prose, and the command
  ends up carrying two contradictory rules. Content for the source harness goes
  in a visible block; content for the others goes inside the comment:

  ```markdown
  <!-- projectstore:harness-alt only=codex
  2. **Scan `AGENTS.md`** — this harness reads it natively.
  -->
  ```

  A test enforces the split in both directions, so you cannot get it backwards
  silently.

  For a whole file, use frontmatter instead — `harness-only: claude-code`, as
  `commands/statusline.md` does. A surface gated out of *every* harness fails
  the suite: that is a deleted feature, not a portable one.
* **The prose did not need to name a harness** → rephrase it.

## Adding a harness

Copy `harnesses/codex.json`, change the values, run the generator, install it:

```bash
node scripts/build-adapters.mjs
node scripts/install-harness.mjs --harness <id> /path/to/project
node scripts/smoke-harness.mjs --harness <id> /path/to/project
```

No source surface and no code changes — that is the claim the design makes, and
it is checked two ways. A test asserts the installer and the preflight name no
harness in their code, so a `if (id === "codex")` cannot creep back in. And it
was verified by adding a throwaway third harness twice: once to watch all 30
surfaces appear from a values-only manifest, and again after the tooling was
generalised, to watch both scripts accept it, require `--harness` now that the
choice was ambiguous, and render that flag into the messages they print back.

What the manifest has to answer:

* `runtime` — the environment variables and config directories it uses.
* `tools` — its write-tool names, where a tool call carries its target path, and
  whether it has an interactive approval tool.
* `hooks` — event-name mapping, unsupported events, the write matcher, and the
  placeholder the installer substitutes with an absolute path.
* `surfaces` — where each surface lives, in what format, and how it is invoked.
* `rewrites` — the token translation table. Rules apply in declared order by
  substring replacement; tests enforce both that a specific rule precedes its
  catch-all and that no rule rewrites another's output.
* `lint.forbidden_unmapped` — regexes for what CANNOT be derived: product
  names, command namespaces, UI affordances. Every other harness's write-tool
  names and environment variables are generated by `lintPatterns()`, because a
  hand-written list only ever contains what someone already thought of — which
  is how `Write`/`Edit` reached Codex carrying a safety prohibition that named
  nothing there.
* `lint.allow` — literal phrases exempt from the derived patterns, each one a
  place where a tool name is not a tool reference (an approval-option label, an
  English verb). Keep it short: it is a hole in the guard, and rephrasing the
  source is always the better fix.
* `capabilities` — what it can and cannot do, so prose stops promising features
  it does not have. Record these from the harness's documentation, not from
  memory: `claude-code.json` shipped with `permission_decision_hook: false`,
  which was simply false, and a doc paragraph was then written to justify the
  asymmetry it invented.

Set `emit: false` only for the harness whose shapes the source is already in —
today that is Claude Code, and exactly one manifest may claim it.

## Installing

```bash
node scripts/install-harness.mjs                 # scope to this project (default)
node scripts/install-harness.mjs /path/to/repo   # scope to another project
node scripts/install-harness.mjs --user          # everything into the harness home
node scripts/install-harness.mjs --trust         # also mark the project trusted
node scripts/install-harness.mjs --dry-run
node scripts/install-harness.mjs --uninstall
```

This script installs a *generated adapter*, so it serves only harnesses with
`emit: true`. Ask it for one that emits nothing and it does not report a
capability gap — it reads that harness's `install` block and prints the commands
that do install it. A harness with `emit: false` must carry that block, and two
tests enforce it: one that the block exists and names a mechanism and steps, one
that those steps actually reach the rendered output. The reason is a real defect
this had: "declares emit: false — no generated adapter to install" answers a
question nobody asked. Someone typing that command wants projectstore installed,
and for Claude Code the answer is not *you cannot*, it is `/plugin marketplace
add`.

`--harness <id>` picks the harness. It is optional while exactly one harness
emits an adapter — naming it would be ceremony — and required the moment a
second does, because guessing between them is the kind of convenience that
installs the wrong thing silently. `--help` describes whichever harness is
selected, reading its scoping and trust rules from the manifest rather than
from prose kept here.

**A second gate exists, and it may or may not ask you.** Codex documents that a
non-managed command hook must have its exact definition reviewed and trusted
before it will run, with trust recorded against the hook's hash. In testing,
granting project trust was sufficient and no separate per-hook approval was
requested — plausibly because the CLI and the desktop app share one
`~/.codex` trust store, so an approval given in either covers both. Treat this
as a thing to check when hooks are listed but idle, not as a step you are
guaranteed to be prompted for.

```
CLI:     /hooks
Desktop: Settings → Hooks → From Projects → <your project>
```

Where it does apply, approval is recorded against the hook's **hash**, so
anything that rewrites a definition — reinstalling after moving the checkout, an
update that changes the command — revokes it. Worth knowing before it happens,
since the cause would be a step already performed once.

This is deliberate: a repository cannot make you execute arbitrary commands by
shipping a `.codex/` directory. projectstore therefore never writes into that
trust store and never will — the review is the user's to give, and an installer
that forged it would be defeating the mechanism that protects its own users.

**Project trust is part of the install, not a detail.** Codex loads a project's
`.codex/` layer — its config *and its hooks* — only when the project is marked
trusted in `~/.codex/config.toml`, and skips the whole layer in silence
otherwise. A project-scoped install into an untrusted project therefore writes
hooks that can never fire, with nothing reporting it. `--trust` adds the stanza:

```toml
[projects."/path/to/repo"]
trust_level = "trusted"
```

The installer exits nonzero rather than claim a success it cannot deliver,
`smoke-harness` fails on it, and `doctor`'s `hooks` finding names it — but only on
a harness that has such a gate and only when this project actually fails it, so
it never appears as noise elsewhere. `--user` installs are unaffected: user-level
hooks do not depend on project trust.

**The install is split, and the split is not a choice.** Skills, agents and
hooks go into `<project>/.codex/` — scoping the hooks is the point, since
home-level hooks fire in *every* Codex project, costing a node process per tool
call in repositories with no vault bound. Slash commands cannot be scoped:
Codex discovers custom prompts only under `$CODEX_HOME/prompts`, with no
project-level equivalent ([openai/codex#4734](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/4734),
[#9848](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/9848)), so a project-only install
would ship no `/projectstore-*` commands at all. Each surface declares its scope
in the manifest and the installer prints both destinations every run.

Two things resolve at install time rather than being committed:
`{{PROJECTSTORE_ROOT}}` and `$PROJECTSTORE_ROOT` become this checkout's absolute
path, and `hooks.json` is **merged** rather than replaced — it is a shared file,
and clobbering a user's own hooks is damage nobody would attribute to a plugin
installer. Uninstall removes only entries whose command names our wrapper.

Hooks run from the checkout, so keep it in place or re-run the installer after
moving it. Restart Codex afterwards: it reads skills, prompts and agents at
startup.

## Verifying it actually works on Codex

Two halves, and the split is the point.

```bash
node scripts/smoke-harness.mjs            # the half that can be checked here
```

Checks that the adapter is current, that the surfaces landed where Codex looks
in the numbers expected, that the hook paths still resolve (they are absolute —
moving the checkout breaks them), and that each hook runs and produces the right
JSON, including a three-file relative `apply_patch` scoring all three paths. Exit
code 1 on any failure.

**What it cannot check is the contract itself.** Everything projectstore believes
about Codex's hook payload was verified against payloads this repository wrote —
an assumption checking an assumption. Only a real session settles it:

```bash
export PROJECTSTORE_HOOK_TRACE=~/.codex/hook-trace.jsonl
# start Codex, edit two files, run /compact, exit
node scripts/smoke-harness.mjs --trace ~/.codex/hook-trace.jsonl
unset PROJECTSTORE_HOOK_TRACE
```

`PROJECTSTORE_HOOK_TRACE` appends every raw hook payload as it arrives. The
summary then answers the three questions everything else rests on: does Codex
set `cwd` (project-root resolution needs it when `CODEX_PROJECT_DIR` is unset),
does `apply_patch` carry its envelope in `tool_input.command`, and do the paths
parse. When one is wrong it names the manifest key to change:

```
✗ apply_patch envelope is NOT in tool_input.command
    Found keys: patch, changes
    Update tools.patch_envelope_field in harnesses/codex.json.
```

Tracing is off unless the variable is set, appends only, and never throws — a
diagnostic that can break a hook is worse than no diagnostic.

Four things stay manual, because they are about Codex's own behaviour:

* **Discovery** — type `/` and look for `/projectstore-adr`; ask Codex which
  projectstore skills and agents it can see. Missing usually means Codex was not
  restarted, or reads a different `CODEX_HOME`.
* **The approval gate** — run `/projectstore-adr "test"` and check Codex stops
  and asks before writing. Here it is prose, not a tool; if it writes without
  asking, that is the known weakness above, not a bug.
* **Agents** — ask it to use the `projectstore-critic` subagent, confirming the
  TOML translation loads and its model/effort keys are accepted.
* **`doctor`** — `node scripts/doctor.mjs --install` inside a Codex session
  should report no statusline and no adapter findings.

### Two Codex differences worth knowing

**The approval gate is prose, not a tool — and on Codex that is all it is.**
Codex has no `AskUserQuestion`, so generated prompts carry a preamble telling
the model to ask in plain text and stop for an answer.

State this plainly rather than around it: projectstore's central promise is *"you
approve every write"*, and on Codex that promise is **honoured by the model, not
enforced by the harness**. A model that ignores the preamble writes without
asking, and nothing detects it.

An earlier version of this page claimed Codex offered a structural gate Claude
Code lacked. That was wrong in both directions. `PreToolUse` accepts
`hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision: "deny"` on **both** harnesses, and
projectstore uses it on **neither**. So this is not an unavoidable Codex
degradation — it is one unimplemented feature, equally available on both, and
the honest next step for the whole plugin rather than a Codex catch-up item.

**One `apply_patch` call can write many files.** Claude Code's write tools carry
one path each; Codex reports a whole patch as a single call. Path extraction is
manifest-driven and returns a list, because taking the first path would
undercount the entry-rule score and log one activity entry where four belonged.

## Binding once, working everywhere

Config lookup searches a neutral location and *every* registered harness's
directory, active one first. A project bound in Claude Code
(`.claude/projectstore.json`) is found unchanged when the same checkout is
opened in Codex — no second bind, no divergent vault.

## What is deliberately not ported

The status line. Codex has no equivalent slot, and `syncStatusLine` returns
`unsupported-harness` rather than writing a settings file the harness never
reads. Faking it with a `systemMessage` line was considered and rejected: a
status line that is actually a message appears once per turn instead of
persisting, which is a different feature wearing the same name.
